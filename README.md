The primary purpose of this project is to scan items and return their prices in the shop where the application is used. We leverage the capabilities of the ZXing scanner, and credit is given to the ZXing project for their scanner integration.

## Usage Instructions

Pressing the "Scan" button opens the scanner page. Point the mobile camera at an item's barcode:

It returns the price of the scanned item.
Alternatively, it opens a page to add the item to the list.
Pressing a list item opens a page showing the entire item list, including names, prices, and addition/edit dates.

Long-pressing an item in the list allows for editing.

Swiping left removes an item.

Scrolling to the top and beyond refreshes the item list.
